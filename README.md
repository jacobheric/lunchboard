## Lunchboard

Lunchboard is a (work in progress) app for organizing a lunch date with friends/colleagues.  

It provides a google map/google places restaurant/eatery search utilizing the [Google Places Javascript Library](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places).  

The map/places widget is unique per client.  The restaurant vote/roster board is shared realtime between all clients (who are using the same event url). 

The app was really created to exercise meteor.  At this point it's basic.

Visit http://lunchboard.jacobheric.com, the app will redirect you to a unique event url that you can share.
